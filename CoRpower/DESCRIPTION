Description: Calculates power for correlates of risk assessment in clinical efficacy trials, as described in Gilbert, Janes, and Huang, "Power/Sample Size Calculations for Assessing Correlates of Risk in Clinical Efficacy Trials" (2016, Statistics in Medicine). The methods differ from past approaches by accounting for the level of treatment efficacy overall and in biomarker response subgroups, and thus enables the correlate of risk efficacy results to be interpreted in terms of potential correlates of efficacy/protection. The methods also account for inter-individual variability of the biomarker that is not biologically relevant (e.g., due to technical measurement error), allowing for assessment of observed biomarkers with components of variability not associated with the outcome. The biomarker is assumed to be normally distributed (continuous) or categorical with two or three levels (dichotomous or trichotomous), measured at a fixed timepoint post-randomization with case-cohort Bernoulli sampling or case-control without-replacement sampling. The package demonstrates the methods by using a logistic regression model and focusing on preventive vaccine trials that assess a correlate of risk in the vaccine group; however, the power calculation methodology can apply more broadly to other binary clinical endpoint models for general randomized controlled two-group clinical trials. To use the package, one can first run the 'computeN()' function to calculate the sample size input parameters needed for the 'computePower()' power calculation function. Output from 'computePower()' can then be visualized using the various plotting functions.
